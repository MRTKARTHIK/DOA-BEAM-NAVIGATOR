📡 DOA Beam Navigator – Built by T Karthik Varma
This project is a modern, production-ready frontend interface for Direction of Arrival (DOA) Estimation and Beam Navigation, built using cutting-edge web technologies. It is an ideal interface for visualizing and interacting with DOA algorithms, including MUSIC, ESPRIT, and advanced beamforming techniques.

Inspired by real-world radar, sonar, and wireless communication applications, the DOA Beam Navigator enables signal processing engineers and researchers to intuitively explore beam angles, signal strengths, and array responses.

🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a real-time visual tool for estimating the Direction of Arrival (DOA) of multiple incoming signals using smart antenna arrays. The app visualizes beam navigation patterns and supports integration with Python/Matlab backends that implement DOA algorithms like:

MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification)

ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques)

Capon Beamformer

MVDR and Bartlett Spectrum

📡 A perfect blend of signal processing, AI/ML, and interactive web UI designed for engineers, researchers, and academic demonstrations.
