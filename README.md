# 📡 DOA Beam Navigator – Built by T Karthik Varma

This project is a modern, production-ready frontend interface for **Direction of Arrival (DOA) Estimation and Beam Navigation**, built using cutting-edge web technologies. It is an ideal interface for visualizing and interacting with DOA algorithms, including MUSIC, ESPRIT, and advanced beamforming techniques.

Inspired by real-world radar, sonar, and wireless communication applications, the **DOA Beam Navigator** enables signal processing engineers and researchers to intuitively explore beam angles, signal strengths, and array responses.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to provide a **real-time visual tool** for estimating the **Direction of Arrival (DOA)** of multiple incoming signals using smart antenna arrays. The app visualizes beam navigation patterns and supports integration with Python/Matlab backends that implement DOA algorithms like:

* MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification)
* ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques)
* Capon Beamformer
* MVDR and Bartlett Spectrum

> 📡 A perfect blend of **signal processing**, **AI/ML**, and **interactive web UI** designed for engineers, researchers, and academic demonstrations.
